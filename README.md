# youtubeSearch

The goal of this project was to be able to view youtube videos without adverts. 
In order to search and display youtube videos, I had to use youtube's API. With the videos loaded, I could present a view that shows the video in the /embed mode, which plays the video without any ads. 
The project was made using django.
