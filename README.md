# youtubeSearch

The goal of this project was to be able to view YouTube videos without ads. 

In order to search and display YouTube videos, I had to use YouTube's API. With the videos loaded, I could present a view that shows the video in the /embed mode, which plays the video without any ads. 

The project was made using Django.
